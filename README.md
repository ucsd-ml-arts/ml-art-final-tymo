## Abstract Proposal

Wouldn't it be cool to generate guitar styles that don't yet exist? Taking inspiration from state of the art GAN results like https://thispersondoesnotexist.com/, we created a basic implementation of GuitarGAN to create images of new guitar shapes and designs.  Our creative goal is to produce photo realistic guitar images that are able to be produced in real life. For the final project we will improve the resolution of our model by 1. Expanding the dataset, and 2. Implementing transfer learning on a pre-trained state-of-the-art StyleGAN, built by Nvidia. As a third option, we could also implement a super-resolution model. We will present a brief visual presentation on various models' ability to produce real guitar images.

## Project Report

Upload your project report (4 pages) as a pdf with your repository, following this template: [google docs](https://docs.google.com/document/d/133H59WZBmH6MlAgFSskFLMQITeIC5d9b2iuzsOfa4E8/edit?usp=sharing).

## Model/Data

Briefly describe the files that are included with your repository:
- trained models
- training data (or link to training data)

## Code

Your code for generating your project:
- Python: generative_code.py
- Jupyter notebooks: generative_code.ipynb

## Results

Documentation of your results in an appropriate format, both links to files and a brief description of their contents:
- What you include here will very much depend on the format of your final project
  - image files (`.jpg`, `.png` or whatever else is appropriate)
  - 3d models
  - movie files (uploaded to youtube or vimeo due to github file size limits)
  - audio files
  - ... some other form

## Technical Notes

Any implementation details or notes we need to repeat your work. 
- Does this code require other pip packages, software, etc?
- Does it run on some other (non-datahub) platform? (CoLab, etc.)
